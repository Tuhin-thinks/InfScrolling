# FlaskNewsAPI

Create a `config.py` file at the base directory of the project.

And add the following lines in the file:
___

#### config.py
```python3
API_KEY = "some_api_key_generated_from_news_api"
```

---
Now you can run the flask project using common commands.

```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
Or, for windows OS, you can search in google about specific run instructions.
